### Hey there! 👋 I'm Omesh

I'm a curious mind who loves turning cool ideas into working products. Whether it's revamping the [IIT Patna Official Website](#) or experimenting with AI and Indian classical music through the **Indian Classical Music Explorer**, I enjoy building full-stack stuff that actually makes life a bit better.

- 🛠️ I tinker, I build, I break (and fix) things.
- 👨‍💻 Hackathon junkie | Open-source explorer | Big on tech that makes noise (AI, blockchain, quantum—yes, all the buzzwords).
- Currently exploring various fields like Open Source ML and blockchain.I feel you should atleast know the basics of every field and be a master in any one of them.

When I’m not staring at VS Code, I’m probably smashing forehands at a table tennis match,Gym workout, rewatching Interstellar, or going down a tech rabbit hole on YouTube.

Let’s connect! I’m always up for collabs, crazy project ideas, or just geeking out over tech.

> ⚡ Scroll down to see what I’ve been building — powered by curiosity, caffeine, and a pinch of chaos.
